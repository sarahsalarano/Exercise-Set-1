# Question 1
penguins

#There are 344 rows and 8 columns.

# Question 2

# Question 3
ggplot(data = penguins)
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes (x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm))
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point()
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

#There appears to be no relationship between the variables, even when the line of best fit is added to the graph. 

# Question 4 

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()

#This creates a scatterplot but the results are organized by categories on the x-axis.
#A better option may be to use a boxplot, like the one below:

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# Question 5: Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?

ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point()

#This code gives an error because the mapping is not specified.
#This can be resolved by mapping aesthetics, for example:

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()

#Question 6: What does the na.rm function do in geom_point()?

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)

#This removes rows that have data missing for the variables specified in the plot's mapping.

#Question 7: Add a caption.

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(caption = "Data comes from the palmerpenguins package.")
