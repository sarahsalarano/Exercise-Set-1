#Exercises 1.2.5 (1-10):
# Question 1
penguins

#There are 344 rows and 8 columns.

# Question 2

#Per the help file, bill_depth_mm is "a number denoting bill depth (millimeters).

# Question 3
ggplot(data = penguins)
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes (x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm))
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point()
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

#There appears to be no relationship between the variables, even when the line of best fit is added to the graph. 

# Question 4 

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()

#This creates a scatterplot but the results are organized by categories on the x-axis.
#A better option may be to use a boxplot, like the one below:

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# Question 5: Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?

ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point()

#This code gives an error because the mapping is not specified.
#This can be resolved by mapping aesthetics, for example:

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()

#Question 6: What does the na.rm function do in geom_point()?

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)

#This removes rows that have data missing for the variables specified in the plot's mapping.

#Question 7: Add a caption.

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(caption = "Data comes from the palmerpenguins package.")

#Question 8: 

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = TRUE)

#bill_depth_mm should be mapped to color at the global level.
#(It doesn't work when mapped at the geom level)

#Question 9:

#This should graph flipper length on the x and mass on the y,
#There should be three distinct colors based on the islands (categorical)
#Because of the factor variable there should be three lines of fit

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

#Question 10:

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_smooth(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))

#These are the same plot.  The difference is that one puts the parameters in the global and the other
#specifies the parameters in each geom.  Because each geom in the second is exactly the same as the 
#global in the first, the graphs are identical.

#Question 1:

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave("mpg-plot.png")

#This code saves the second plot because it is the most recent.

#Question 2:

#To save the file as a PDF instead of a PNG, simply change the file name to "mpg-plot.pdf"
