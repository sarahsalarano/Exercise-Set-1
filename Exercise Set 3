#???

#Question 2

#Question 3

#Question 4

#yes, there are 365 disinct month/day combinations.

#Question 5

Question #6

#Exercises 3.3.5

#Question 1

flights |>
  select(dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay)
#dep_delay = dep_time - sched_dep_time

#Question 2

#simplest way to select:
flights |>
  select(dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)

#selection based on the patterns of variable names
flights |>
  select(starts_with("dep_"),
         starts_with("arr_"))

#selection based on the variable's position in the dataset
flights |>
  select(dep_time, dep_delay:arr_time, arr_delay)

#Question 3

#let's try it.
flights |>
  select(dep_time, dep_time)
#it will only print out once in the Console window.

#Question 4

?any_of()
#it is a selection helper. It is especially useful with negative selections, when
#you would like to make sure a variable is removed. 

#The primary purpose of any_of is to help select columns in a data frame based on 
#a character vector of column names. It is often used in conjunction with functions 
#like select to dynamically choose a subset of columns based on specific conditions 
#or criteria specified in the character vector.

#for example:
variables <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
flights |>
  select(any_of(variables))
#The variables "year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", and "arr_delay" are selected.

#Question 5

flights |> select(contains("TIME"))
flights |> select(contains("time"))
#basically, the select helpers and the "contain()" function don't distinguish upper
#and lower case.

#To change the default, simply run the following:
flights |>
  select(contains("time", ignore.case = FALSE))

#if we change "time" to "TIME", then we find that there is no match.
flights |>
  select(contains("TIME", ignore.case = FALSE))

#Question 6

flights |>
  rename(air_time_min = air_time) |>
  relocate(air_time_min)

#Question 7

flights |> 
  select(tailnum) |> 
  arrange(arr_delay)

#when you execute the first and the second line, the output data frame only contains
#one variable, which is "tailnum". Then it is pointless to arrange accoring to
#"arr_delay", which is not even in the data frame now.
#To correct the error, simply run the following:

flights |> 
  select(tailnum, arr_delay) |> 
  arrange(arr_delay)

#By this way, you keep both variables and rank them with an ascending order of "arr_delay".

#Question 1

        summarize(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>

filter(airlines, carrier == "OO")

#It's difficult to fully disentangle the effect of bad airports, but one step is to
#group by carrier and airports (destinations and origins), then calculating delay by carrier.
#Next, average over the airports to which the carrier flies.
#Finally, group by carrier and summarize the arrival delay, then slice the longest for the answer
#this suggests "OO" (Skywest Airlines) has the worst average delays when accounting for airport

#Question 2

print(df3 <- df |>

ggplot(data = df4, aes(x = sched_dep_time, y = avg_delay)) +

#Specifying a negative number in a slice function returns all observations and does not slice
#In other words it "un-slices" over the whole dataframe but keeps the grouping

#Question 5

#The count function counts the number of observations in each group of variables
#When sort is set to TRUE, the largest groups are moved to the top

#Question 6

df <- tibble(
  x = 1:5,
  y = c("a", "b", "a", "a", "b"),
  z = c("K", "K", "L", "L", "K")
)

#a

#group_by y should code y as the grouping variable, but nothing will appear to have
#changed because no other action is taken

df |>
  group_by(y)

#b

#arrange should sort values from smallest to largest by default, and thus will sort
#the three 'a' values to the top because R will sort alphabetically in a <chr> column

df |>
  arrange(y)

#c

#This should group into 'a' values and 'b' values in y, then average the values in
#column x in those groups, giving two rows with an average for a and for b.
#(1+3+4)/3 = a and (2+5)/2 = b

df |>
  group_by(y) |>
  summarize(mean_x = mean(x))

#d

#This should create three groups (aK, aL, and bK) and average x values in each
#1 = aK, (3+4)/2 = aL, (5+2)/2 = bK

df |>
group_by(y, z) |>
  summarize(mean_x = mean(x))

#e

#This produces the same result as d, but the warning message is suppressed

df |>
  group_by(y, z) |>
  summarize(mean_x = mean(x), .groups = "drop")

#f

#these do similar but slightly different things. They each give the average by group but differ in output
#summarize provides one average for each group, excluding the x column and creating a mean_x column with the mean values
#mutate creates a new column and provides the average in each row based on the group for that row
#the difference is a 3x3 output for summarize and a 5x4 output for mutate

df |>
  group_by(y, z) |>
  summarize(mean_x = mean(x))

df |>
  group_by(y, z) |>
  mutate(mean_x = mean(x))
